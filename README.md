Does not run on Chrome for some reason.

## Quickstart

clone this repo, and open index.html in a browser other than Google Chrome.

you can also change some of the constants in `draw.js` to get different results, such as minDist, radius, and numPoints

You can also use a different image, just put it in the same directory as this project and name it `text.jpg`.
