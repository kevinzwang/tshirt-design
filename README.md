# tshirt-design

Code for submission if the 2018 Carlmont High School Computer Science department T-Shirt design contest.

Does not run on Chrome for some reason.

## Quickstart

clone this repo, and open index.html in a browser other than Google Chrome.

you can also change some of the constants in draw.js to get different results, such as minDist, radius, and numPoints

You can also use a different image, just change the img.src in draw.js to the file name, and also the width and height of the canvas in index.html
